### When you feel depressed, you can hold a tree!

To stay safe during the corovirus pandemic, we have had to **sacrifice（牺牲）** many things we enjoy, including **physical contact** with others. **Gone are handshakes, kisses and hugs.**

Research has shown that humans need **physical touch** to stay mentally and physically healthy. Without it, many become lonely, sad and even sick.

So, if you feel you need a hug, we know something you can safely put your arms around and hold close: A tree! Tree hunting may sound a little strange.

But humans have practiced **forms of nature therapy**  for years. The Japanese practice of *Shinrin-Yoku* is an example.

*Shinrin* **means forest in Japanese**, and *Yoku* **is the Japanese word for bath**. But no soap or water is needed for *shinrin-yoku*.

All that nature bathing requires is spending time in nature: **listening to its sounds, breathing in its scent（气味，香味）, connecting to its life force**. Recently, Israel has been promoting tree hugging on social media.

The country's nature and parks agency **is behind** the public health campaign. Orit Steinfeld is **marketing director （市场营销主管）** for Israel's Apollonia National Park. 

"In this unpleasant corona period," she said, **"we recommend（推荐，建议） to people around the world to go out to nature, take a deep breath, hug a tree, express your love and get love"**.

The park is about 15 kilometers north of Tel Aviv. Inside the park, some visitors **observed the official's advice（遵守建议）** and hugged trees.

Barbara Grant was one of them. **"The most basic human need"**, she said, **"is for connection, for touching, for hugging"**.
