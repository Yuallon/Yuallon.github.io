**The technology development and aging.** This is a good topic. 

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of people aged 60 and above was 253.88 million in 2019, that is 18.1 percent of China's population. But only 23 percent of the senior citizens were able to access the internet.

**With the advent of** online payment, which greatly makes our lives easier. Wherever we go, we can **make payment** only with a phone. However this is a big challenge to senior citizens. 

For example, one **has access to** entry into many public places who has the internet-based health code during the pandemic. Although the health code is convenient to us, but it also deprive of older people right. 

What should we do? Technology should serve human being. We should **keep an eye on seior citizens** when we strive to improve our life quality. It should be a society's responsibility to help them bridge the digital gap and **be patient with them**.
