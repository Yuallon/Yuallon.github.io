### Part One: Understand your audience

You should ask yourself some questions before you writing:

- Who are you writing for?

  friend/colleague/teacher/manager/examiner/etc?

- What are you trying to achieve?

  - Give someone information?
  - Convince somebody of your point?
  - Entertain somebody?
  - Give someone advice?
  - ...

- What does your reader want?

  Why your reader spent his/her time to read what you have writen?

### Part Two: Plan your writing

You'd better to list some important information before your writing. 

- What ideas are you going to include?
- What ideas are you going to leave out?
- How are you going to organize your ideas?
- Write your ideas down.

#### Deciding what to include:

- Think about your goals.
- Think about your reader's needs.

### Part Three: Organize your ideas into clear paragraphs

It helps your reader see where you're going and why, and it helps you to stay focused on your plan and reaching your goal.

#### Using paragraphs:

- One main idea per paragraph
- Don't try to do too much in one paragraph
- There's no minimum length for a paragraph

### Part Four: Cut empty words and sentences

#### Write as little as possible:

- Don't use two words if you can use one word.

  very tired --> exhausted

  as a result --> consequently

  on the other hand --> nevertheless

  This will improve (get better) in the future.

### Part Five: Use short, simple sentences where possible

- Short sentences are easier to read and understand.
- 10 words is a good target
- 20+ words could be dangerous
- Don't use the passive voice unless you need to
- Put your subject at the start of the snetence
- Don't use relative clauses unless you really need to
- Consider breaking longer sentences into shorter ones
- and, or, but ...
- Use longer, more complex sentences only if you can't express your idea in a simpler way.
