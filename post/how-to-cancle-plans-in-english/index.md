Sometimes, we have to cancel our plans with someone due to something unexpected. Maybe we are sick. Maybe we have to go to work. When we have to cancel plans, it's important to know how to do **it in a polite** that does not hurt the feelings or offend the feelings of other people.

###Here list 5 easy steps

First, ask "How are you doing?",when you meet your friend or call them.

Then, apologize or say sorry.

1. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to cancel our meeting/plan.
2. I won't be able to **make our dinner/meeting**.
3. I **was** really looking forward to our meeting/hanging out/seeing you.
4. Reason + BUT ...
   - Something has come up
   - I'm **swamped with work**.
   - I'm sick/I have a flu.
5. Reschedule
   Can we reschedule?



####Tip:

If someone cancel a lot for bad reason, we call them *flake* in English. 

She is a flake.

She always flakes out on plans.
