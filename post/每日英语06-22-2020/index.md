### Seven steps can stop bad information

We want to help our family and friends when we read some information going viral on the  internet, especially COVID-19. Here are some advice to help us avoid the fishy site. 

#### 1 Stop and think

One thing you can do to halt misinformation is to simply stop and think. If you have any doubts, pause, and check it out further.

#### 2 Check your source

Before you forward it on, ask some basic questions about where the information comes from.

#### 3 Could it be fake?

It is possible to impersonate official accounts and authorities. If you can't easily find the website information, it might be a hoax.

#### 4 Unsure whether it's true? Don't share

Don't forward things on "just in case" they might be true. You might be doing more harm than good.

#### 5 Check each fact, individually

But it's a mix of accurate and inaccurate advice.

#### 6 Beware emotional posts

It's the stuff that gets us fearful, angry, anxious, or joyful that tends to really go viral.

#### 7 Think about biases

Are you sharing something because you know it's true - or just because you agree with it?
